# Team Project - Restaurant Management System

This repository contains my second year team project for our Team project module. Our task was to design and build a full featured Restaurant Management System, and our final submission achieved:

- 95% overall mark on my report card
-  100% individual contribution score

This success wouldn’t have been possible without the incredible teamwork and collaboration of my peers.

Our instructions were to build a restaurant management system for the following user stories:
